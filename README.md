# mixedVinyl
Hi, there, my name is Alena. About a month ago I've started my fascinating journey with Symfony 6. Thanks to Symfonycasts and its course "Harmonious Development with Symfony 6", I am able to code my first Symfony project: music app 'mixedVinyl'.
At this moment the following topics already done: 
<ul>  
<li>
  Routes, Controllers & Responses
  </li>
  <li > 
  Wildcart
    </li>
  <li>Symfonyflex </li>
  <li>Flex Recipes </li>
  <li>Twig </li>
  <li>Profiler</li>
  <li> Bundles </li>
</ul>
In a future tutorial, we're going to create a database to manage songs, genres, and the mixed vinyl records that our users are creating. 
Right now, we're working entirely with hardcoded data... 
That's why stay tuned! It will be more powerful!
